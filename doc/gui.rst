GUI

**signac** provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) which makes configuration and inspecting database records easier.

.. sidebar:: Warning

    The gui package is in an *early development status*.

The gui requires ``PySide`` libraries.
The installation of ``PySide`` libraries exceeds the scope of this manual, but they can possibly be installed via ``conda`` or ``pip``.

To start the gui, either execute

.. code:: bash

   $ signac-gui

or

.. code:: bash

   $ python -m signac.gui.gui

on the command line.
