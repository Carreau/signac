Gui

**signac** provides a graphical user interface (gui) which makes configuration and viewing database records easier.
The gui is in an *early development status*.

The gui requires ``PySide`` libraries.
The installation of ``PySide`` libraries exceeds the scope of this manual, but they can possibly be installed via ``conda`` or ``pip``.

To start the gui, either execute 

.. code:: bash
   
   $ python -m signac.gui.gui

or

.. code:: bash

   $ signac-gui
