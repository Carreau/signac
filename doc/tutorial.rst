Tutorial

.. sidebar:: Requirementes

    The tutorial assumes a basic proficiency in python.
    The first chapter will take about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement a basic computational workflow with signac.
The signac framework assists us in conducting a computational investigation by managing the data space for us.
This means that we do not need to worry about how to organize our data on disk and how to keep track of meta data.

**As a beginner, make sure to complete the first chapter.
The second chapter deals with more advanced topics that may not be of interest to everyone.**
