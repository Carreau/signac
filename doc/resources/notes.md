# Data format

There are a number of markup languages and data formats, that represent chemical and molecular data.

## Chemical Markup Language (ChemML)

The project's website:

[http://www.xml-cml.org/]

# Cambridge Structural Database

See wikipedia.

Uses the [CIF format](http://www.iucr.org/resources/cif).

# Materials Genome Project

White House Initiative to facilitate fast-paced materials development.
I did not find any database, which is available because of that.

# Tools

## DiffPy

Calculate diffraction patterns.
